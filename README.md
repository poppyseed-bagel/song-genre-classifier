# Multi-Classification of songs to genre

## Grade: 78/100 (Distinction)

Group project for Applied Machine Learning. This classifier looks at a dataset of 10,000+ song lyrics and audio features which have been pre-labeled as one of four genres. The project required data cleaning, feature selection / engineering, and model optimization. The project used 3 different algorithims: Neural Networks, Random Forest, and XGBoost. We found that the XGBoost model performed the best, with a CV error of .68 and a test error of .67.

This task involves classification of songs into four genres: pop, rap, rock, and hip hop. These songs and their respective audio and text features have been gathered from the Spotify and Genius APIs respectively.
